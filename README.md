# Forecasting-Consumer-Price-Index-using-Time-Series-Forecasting

## Motivation
Out of curiosity, I wanted to see whether the **unemployment rate**, **real personal income**, **Fed Funds rate** and **stock price index** have any historical relationship with inflation. 

Economists often refer to the Phillips Curve, showing a trade-off between inflation and **unemployment**. Looking at the data we have plotted below, the trade-off holds true? 

Do stock markets have any predictive power for inflation? **S&P500** is used as Composite index to derive its relationship with inflation.

The Fed Reserve lowers inflation by raising interest rates. Is the **Fed Funds rate** useful for prediction?

In the project, we have tried to answer all these questions.

## Model Framework

## OBSERVATION
* Despite some outliers, there appears a curved negative relation between the **unemployment rate** and inflation, providing some visual evidence for the Phillips Curve. This relation is broken down into various subsamples below. 

* There's no clear relationship between **stock markets** and inflation, contrary to popular beliefs.
* There appears to be a positive upward-sloping relationship between the **Fed Funds rate** and inflation. This is not surprising, given that monetary policy responds to inflation (and vice versa).

**Explanation for Outliers:** Outliers may be explained by trends across 1970 and 1980. 
* In the 70s, the US economy experienced high inflation. The clustering of low inflation values from 1980-1999 may correspond to the recession of the 1980s, following aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed in response to the high inflation in the 70s. **Great Depression.**
* Similarly the **Great Recession** in 2008-2009 had a similar impact on US economy
